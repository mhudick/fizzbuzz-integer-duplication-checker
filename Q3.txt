A)
I have a morning ritual where I wake up and I make a pot of coffee.
I'll list my steps off in order
1) Wake up and come out of sleep - 3 minutes
    toss, turn, rub eyes, whatever it takes to wake up
2) Make way to bathroom and brush teeth, shave if necessary and do any other business - ~11 minutes
    take out tooth brush and tooth paste - 10 seconds
    remove toothpaste lid then squeeze paste onto tooth brush - 5 seconds
    start water on to heat while wetting tooth brush 2 minutes
    brush teeth waiting for water to heat ^ combined effort
    water is hot clean up tooth brush and plug drain - 1 minute
    apply water to face 15 seconds
    apply shaving soap to face 30 seconds
    Shaving brush to soap on face until properly lathered 30 seconds
    acquire razor from stand 5 seconds
    single pass shave 3 minutes
    splash water on face 15 seconds
    check for nicks if nick alum spot 15 seconds
    clean brush and razor 1 minute
    drain water and clean sink 1 minute
3) travel downstairs and to the kitchen- 30 seconds
4) check water levels in kettle - 10 seconds
5) if water is empty fill kettle then boil water - 7 minutes, else boil water - 6 minutes
6) prepare coffee beans for grind by measuring out beans then grinding - 2 minutes
7) prepared pour over method
    if chemex 3 minutes
        slowly heat up container
        prepare filter
        add grounds
        remove liquid from prep
    if french press 1 minute
      warm container
      add grounds
    if V60 15 seconds
      prepare filter
      add grounds
8) when water is done boiling pour water over grounds, 3 passes - 5 minutes
9) let rest - 2 minutes
10) prepare mug - 10 seconds
11) pour - 10 seconds
12) drink - 10 - 15 minutes

B) optimized routine

1) Wake up, don't toss and turn. 15 seconds
2) Make way to bathroom and brush teeth - REMOVE SHAVING, SHAVE THE NIGHT BEFORE. 2 minutes 15 seconds
    take out tooth brush and tooth paste - 10 seconds
    remove toothpaste lid then squeeze paste onto tooth brush - 5 seconds
    wet tooth brush and brush teeth - 2 minutes
    SHAVE THE NIGHT BEFORE!
3) travel downstairs and to the kitchen- 30 seconds
4) no need to brew coffee its already made because I used my timed coffee maker settle to brew 15 minutes before wake up - all prep done night before
5) prepare mug - 10 seconds
6) pour - 10 seconds
7) drink - 10 - 15 minutes

one thing I noticed while optimizing my routine is that my typical routine is all done procedurally.
When I optimized things I began to realize that I could everything in a pre-generated tasks that I could do prior
to when I normally would.  Without realizing it I essentially turned my wake up, my shaving, my teeth brush, and coffee making
into objects that have their methods written out and ready to go. With a bit of setup time I was able to shave dramatic type off of my daily routine.
Thats a pretty big deal and really lends itself to the positive nature of object oriented programming.
